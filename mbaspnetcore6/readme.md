# ASP.NET Core 6

1. Eco-System For Building Modern Web Apps
    - Object Models
        - Dependency Injection Container (DI) is In-Built
            - THis registers all dependencies as 'services' in the Application
                - Database Connections
                - Session
                - Identity

                - Object Model for
                    - Razor Views
                    - MVC Controllers, Views, and API Controllers
                    - API Controllers
                - Custom Services
                - ... and many more
        - Middlewares
            - Objects used for Managing HTTP Request Processing
                - Exception Management
                - Session Management
                - CORS Management
                - Identityt Management
                - Routing
                - Accessong Local Files on Server
                - Executing the COntrollers or Pages
# ASP.NET Core MVC Project Structure (.NET 6) (.NET Core 1.x to .NET 5, we had Startup.cs and Program.cs. The Startup.cs file is deprecated)
    - Program.cs
        - Entry-Point for the Application
            - Loading the Application Configuration
            - Registering Services as Dependency in DI Container
            - Registring Middlewares and Managing HTTP Request Pipeline
    - appsettings.json
        - Defines Application Level Configirations
            - e.g.
                - Hosting

    - Controllers
        - These classes are used to accept HTTP Requests with data
        - Update Models
        - Decides which View is Responded
    - Views
        - Contains Razor Views (.cshtml), these are MVC Views used for User Interaction

# ADO.NET

- High-Speed Data Access Technology for Microsoft .NET Apps
- The 'System.Data', the Assembly (a Package) for Data Access Object Model
    - The 'System.Data.SqlClient', a Package for SQL Server
- Various Classes
    - SqlConnection
        - Used to Manage teh Database Connection
        - Open(), OpenAsync(), methdos to Open Connection With Database
        - Close(), CloseAsync(), methods to Close Database Connection
        - ConnectionString property, that accepts Connection String as input
            - Examples of Connection String
            - Case 1: Using Windows Admin user to connect to Database
                - Data Source=[SERVER-NAME];Initial Catalog=[DATABASE-NAME];Integrated Security=SSPI
                    - SERVER-NAME: The Name of the MAchine where the SQL Server Instance is Running
                        - localhost (if using local machine) OR IP ADDRESS OR . (if using the Local Machine)
                - e.g.
                    - Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Companyl;Integrated Security=SSPI;
            - Case 2: Using SQL Server Authentication
                - Data Source=[SERVER-NAME];Initial Catalog=[DATABASE-NAME];User Id=[SQL-SERVER-USER-ID];Password=[Password];
                - e.g.
                    - Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;
            - Follow the SWebSite
                - https://www.connectionstrings.com/microsoft-data-sqlclient/
                
    - SqlCommand 
        - Used to Perform DB Transactions (Read/Write) Operations with Database over the Connection
        - The 'Connection' property, this accepts the Connection object to Database over which the Read/Write Operations are performed
        - CommandType
            - Property that represents the Type of Statement to be executed on the Database Server
            - CommandType.Text, accepts a string which contains Query e.g. Select, Insert, Update, and Delete
            - CommandType.StoredProcedute, accept the Stored Procedure name
                - CommandText="Stored-Procedure-Name"
        - Execute Methods
            - ExecuteReader(), ExecuteReaderAsync()
                - Returns an Instance of 'SqlDataReader' class when the CommandText is 'Select' Statement
                - SqlDataReader: The Read-Only-Forward-Only Cursor, that reads data from First Record and Move to next till last record
                    - The 'Read()' method to start reading
                    - The 'Close()' method to CLose the Reader
            - ExecuteNonQuery(), ExecuteNotQueryAsync()
                - USed when the ComamndText is DML Statement (Insert, Update and Delete)
                - This method will return a 'Non-Zero' number that represents no. of records affected
            - ExecuteScalar(), ExecuteScalarAsync()
                - Used when the Select Query returns a Single Value e.g. Min, Max, Average, etc.
                - We can use while working with Stored Procs
    - SqlParameter
        - The class that represent the Parameter passed to
            - Parameterized Query
            - Stored Proc
        - Properties
            - ParameterName
                - Actual NAme of the Paremeter passed to a Query or SP
            - Direction
                - Input or Output Parameter
            - DbType
                - SQL Data Type
            - Size
                - MUST be set for String Parameter
            - Value
                 - Value to be passed to the Parameter   
    - Pseduo Code
        - Create an Instance of SqlConnection by using the Connection String
        - Open the Connection
        - Defien an instance of SqlCommand
        - Pass connection object to the Connection Property of Command class
        - Set the CommandType for The Command Instance as Text or Stored Procedure
        - Set the CommandText property of the Command Instance as either Query or Stored Procedure name dependning on the CommandType
        - Invoke an Execute Method based on CommandText
        - If the SqlDataReader as return from Command's execute method then use 'Read()' method to read data and then 'Close()' reader
        - If the DML Operations then cehck for Non-Zero value from the Execute method of Command object
        - Close() the connection
